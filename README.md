## Are you tired of your project script language being **slow**, *stubborn* or hard to maintain?

### Don't answer, just look at ketl

Ketl is Embedded Typed Language


## It's fast (enough)

Ketl is a strong type script language. So, most of the checks are made before running your code.
* Null pointers? Pointer data structers can't be null.*
* Array range check? I trust you, you can't miss.**

<sup> 
* - Pointers can be flagged as nullable
** - Check can be enabled before compilation
</sup>

### Early tests shows, that ketl is around 1.2 times faster than LuaJIT in random operations! (sometimes)

## It's flexible (diabetes caution)

* Function overloading?         - Yes
* Currying?                     - Yes
* Calling functions as methods? - Yes
* Metaprogramming?              - As powerful as language it is

## It's supportive

Included debuger options help you maintain your code with:

* Breakpoints through API
* Changing your code or code state while in break
* Tools to dump your client's state and send it to you for detailed debug
